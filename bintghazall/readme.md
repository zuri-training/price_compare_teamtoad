## How it works

There are two categories of users that are allowed on the application

- Unauthenticated User : User without a registered account on the application (roaming Visitor) 
- Authenticated User : User with a registered account on the application

These users have different priviledges as stated below.

#### Unauthenticated users

These users has free access to the application's landing page, view basic information and documentation. 

They can interact with the documentation like click "read more" and be redirected to page or section to read more, they can also browse through available products but not interact with them. 

To interact with products and view more details they will have to register using the sign-up button/link provided on the page.

#### Authenticated users
These are registered or authenticated users they have full access to the application. They can comment under product/price that is displayed in response to there search and available products on the page. These comments are loaded from the database on the page the user interacts with everytime he or she login to use the application service(s).

When and If an authenticated user found a product with their prefered price, he/she have a link below the product of interest that redirects he/she to vendor's platform to complete his/her order.

They can also share the product they found on the page or result of their search with other people on social media or via email.
